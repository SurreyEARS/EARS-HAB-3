# EARS-HAB-3

This repository contains the hardware and software for the HAB-3 board. This board is based on the STM32F3303VC, a microcontroller from ST Microelectronics based on the Cortex-M4.

This project's goal is to provide experience working with bare metal microcontrollers. Also ideally a working flight computer!

And discussion on the forums: http://forum.surreyears.co.uk/topic/36/hab-3

The toolchain for this project is the free version of Atollic TrueSTUDIO for ARM (http://timor.atollic.com/truestudio/), backed up by arm-atollic-eabi-gcc (same installer).

We have two STM32F3 DISCOVERY development boards for working on this; one is currently with Revanth and the other is with James.
